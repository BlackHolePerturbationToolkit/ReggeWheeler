# ReggeWheeler

The ReggeWheeler package provides a set of functions for computing solutions
to the Regge Wheeler equation for perturbations about the spacetime of a
Schwarzschild black hole.


### Requirements

Mathematica: ReggeWheeler requires version 10.2 or newer of Mathematica. It is
             typically tested with only the latest available version.


### Installation

### Documentation

After installation, examples and tutorials are available from the
ReggeWheeler page in the Mathematica Documentation Center.


### Known problems
